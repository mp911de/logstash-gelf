It is essential that you verify the integrity of the downloaded files using the PGP or MD5 signatures.

The PGP signatures can be verified using PGP or GPG. First download the
[KEYS](http://logging.paluch.biz/KEYS) as well as the asc signature file for the relevant distribution.
Make sure you get these files from Maven Central rather
than from a mirror. Then verify the signatures using


    % gpg --import KEYS
    % gpg --verify logstash-gelf-${logstash-gelf-release-version}.jar.asc


Alternatively, you can verify the MD5 signature on the files. A unix program called md5 or md5sum is included
in many unix distributions.
